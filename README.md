Jump Ship Jam 2023 Team Noline

### info

* Godot 3.5.2
* GLES2 render engine

### build: 
https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.5/tutorials/export/exporting_for_web.html
* tldr there's a 'play in browser' button in the top right of the editor. We can probably get the app hosted on github pages soon though.

### warnings:

This warning is expected for windows users:
`warning: in the working copy of 'README.md', LF will be replaced by CRLF the next time Git touches it`
